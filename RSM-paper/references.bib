                Research synthesis, such as comparative and meta-analyses, requires the extraction of effect sizes from primary literature, which are commonly calculated from descriptive statistics. However, the exact values of such statistics are commonly hidden in figures.
              
              
                Extracting descriptive statistics from figures can be a slow process that is not easily reproducible. Additionally, current software lacks an ability to incorporate important meta-data (e.g., sample sizes, treatment / variable names) about experiments and is not integrated with other software to streamline analysis pipelines.
              
              
                
                  Here we present the R package
                  metaDigitise
                  which extracts descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations and correlations from four plot types: 1) mean/error plots (e.g. bar graphs with standard errors), 2) box plots, 3) scatter plots and 4) histograms.
                  metaDigitise
                  is user-friendly and easy to learn as it interactively guides the user through the data extraction process. Notably, it enables large-scale extraction by automatically loading image files, letting the user stop processing, edit and add to the resulting data-frame at any point.
                
              
              
                Digitised data can be easily re-plotted and checked, facilitating reproducible data extraction from plots with little inter-observer bias. We hope that by making the process of figure extraction more flexible and easy to conduct it will improve the transparency and quality of meta-analyses in the future.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colorectal cancer. Method A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed comparing survival in patients with resected stage II colorectal cancer and high-risk features having postoperative chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Results Of 1031 articles screened, 29 were included, reporting on 183,749 participants. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001), disease-specific survival (HR=0.73, P=0.05), and disease-free survival (HR=0.59, P{$<$}0.0001) compared to no chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased 5-year overall survival (odds ratio [OR]=0.53, P=0.0008) and 5-year disease-free survival (OR=0.50, P=0.001). Overall survival and disease-free survival remained significantly prolonged during subgroup analysis of studies published from 2015 onwards (HR=0.60, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.65, P=0.0001; respectively), in patients with two or more high-risk features (HR=0.59, P=0.0001; HR=0.70, P=0.03; respectively), and in colon cancer (HR=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.51, P=0.0001; respectively). Overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival during subgroup analysis of individual high-risk features, were: T4 tumour (HR=0.58, P{$<$}0.0001; HR 0.50, P=0.003; HR 0.75, P=0.05), {$<$}12 lymph nodes harvested (HR=0.67, P=0.0002; HR=0.80, P=0.17; HR=0.72, P=0.02), poor differentiation (HR=0.84, P=0.35; HR=0.85, P=0.23; HR=0.61, P=0.41), lymphovascular or perineural invasion (HR=0.55, P=0.05; HR=0.59, P=0.11; HR=0.76, P=0.05), emergency surgery (HR=0.60, P=0.02; HR=0.68, P=0.19). Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colorectal cancer results in a modest survival improvement and should be considered on an individual patient basis. Due to potential heterogeneity and selection bias of the included studies, and lack of separate rectal cancer data, further large randomized trials with predefined inclusion criteria and standardized chemotherapy regimens are required.},
